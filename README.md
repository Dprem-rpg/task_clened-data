I used Excel Power Query to clean and prepare raw data. The process involved the following steps:

Removing Unwanted Rows and Columns: Filtered out unnecessary data to focus on relevant information.

Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Handling Missing Values: Replaced null values with "No Info" to standardize missing data.

Text Standardization: Applied text transformations, including converting text to uppercase, lowercase, and trimming extra spaces, to ensure consistency across all columns.

This cleaning process ensures the data is structured, uniform, and ready for analysis.
